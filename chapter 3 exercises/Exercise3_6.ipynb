Say, for very large n; $n \\to \\infty$, then the most practical program to use will either be Seidel's or Pettie & Ramachandran's since the other algorithm, Dijkstra's included approaches $\\mathcal{O}(\\infty)$ faster than the previous two. The final answer, if it's Seidel's or P&R's, will then depend on the number of edges $m$ and the factor $\\alpha(n,m)$. As for small $n$, then the most practical algorithm to use is Thorup's.\r\n",
